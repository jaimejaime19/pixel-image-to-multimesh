Turn your pixel image into a 3d multimesh!

Use a blank white (or any color) image, trace some path with another color on the image, and import that image into the project. 
Attach the script PixelImageToMultimesh to a MultiMeshInstance3D, create a mesh, choose the color you want the mesh to appear on, click on "Regenerate Blueprint" in the inspector, and you got yourself several quickly-placed meshes!
There are a lot of variables you can change in the inspector like positioning, scaling, rotation, and even add collision! 

This can be used to prototype levels for a game without needing to place the assets manually, or even going into the editor really. I used it to spawn tons of trees and shrubs on the ground as well as generate walls for a level for this example

Took inspiration from a similar tool I saw online but couldn't find it anymore. Feel free to use this code as I won't be making any changes to it.
